# UM-Projects
This repo is basically my mini–ML multiverse 🤌. I worked on multiple healthcare + pricing prediction projects during my UM internship, using different machine learning models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Each project is in its own folder with code, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

🔥 Projects Included
1. Vehicle Price Prediction

Predicts vehicle selling prices using features like year, mileage, fuel type, etc.
Used Linear Regression with proper preprocessing for accurate price prediction.

2. Heart Disease Prediction

Classification model to predict heart disease presence using patient attributes.
Built with Random Forest + preprocessing (encoding, scaling) for strong performance.

3. Lung Cancer Survival Prediction

Predicts patient survival based on medical features.
Implemented using Random Forest with one-hot encoding, scaling, and pipelines for smooth workflow.

4. Thyroid Cancer Classification

Classifies patients as cancer/no-cancer from their health stats.
Used Logistic Regression with proper preprocessing and evaluation metrics.

🎯 Skills Highlighted

Data Preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling)

Model Building (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Train-test splits & accuracy  

Structured workflow with pipelines

Real-world healthcare + pricing datasets
