# UM-Projects
This repo is basically my mini–ML multiverse 🤌. I worked on multiple healthcare + pricing prediction projects during my UM internship, using different machine learning models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Each project is in its own folder with code, data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
